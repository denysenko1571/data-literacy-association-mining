# 📚 Association Rule Mining for Data Literacy Teaching Strategies

This project explores frequent attribute combinations and strong association rules within a dataset of academic papers on Data Literacy fostering.
It is done as a potential part of my work for the Introduction to Research in Information Systems.

## 🛠 Features

- Binary preprocessing of the dataset to prepare for frequent pattern mining.

- Frequent itemset discovery using the FP-Growth algorithm.

- Generation of strong association rules based on lift values.

- Clear, human-readable output to easily understand the most important patterns.
